# Impact of Amazon Deforestation on Bird Diversity

## Overview
This project investigates the relationship between deforestation in the Amazon rainforest and changes in bird species diversity. Using publicly available environmental and biodiversity datasets, the analysis explores whether increasing deforestation rates are associated with declines in bird species presence across regions.


## Research Questions
- How have deforestation rates changed across regions of the Amazon over time?
- Are higher deforestation levels associated with reduced bird species diversity?
- What regional or temporal patterns emerge when comparing land-use change and biodiversity data?


## Data Sources
- **Deforestation Data:** Global Forest Wacth (GFW)
- **Biodiversity Data:** Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)



## Methodology
The analysis follows a structured data science workflow:

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and inconsistent entries
   - Filtered data to relevant geographic regions and time periods
   - Merged deforestation and biodiversity datasets using shared spatial and temporal attributes

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Examined trends in deforestation rates across regions
   - Analyzed changes in bird species richness and occurrence
   - Compared biodiversity metrics across areas with varying levels of deforestation

3. **Visualization & Interpretation**
   - Created visualizations to highlight ecological trends and regional differences
   - Interpreted results to assess potential links between habitat loss and biodiversity decline



## Key Findings
- Regions experiencing higher deforestation rates tend to show lower bird species diversity.
- Temporal analysis suggests biodiversity declines often follow periods of intensified land-use change.
- While correlation does not imply causation, the observed patterns highlight potential ecological risks associated with deforestation.



## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook
