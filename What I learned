Working through this project taught me a lot about Python and gave me more confidence to use it for real-world data analysis. 
I learned how to manage large, messy datasets using pandas,from selectively loading millions of rows to cleaning, filtering, and transforming them efficiently which are skills I had never used like this before. 
I also learned how to pull data by making API requests and handling JSON responses (which was very new to me). 
As I progressed, I became comfortable merging datasets, creating new variables, visualizations with matplotlib, and applying statistical tools like correlations, lag analyses, and linear regression through scikit-learn. 
Even implementing more techniques like threshold detection and piecewise regression pushed me to learn them from scratch and think creatively about how to translate ideas into code. 
Overall, this project helped me realize how much Python enables me to do, and it significantly expanded both my technical skills and my confidence in using programming to answer desired questions.
